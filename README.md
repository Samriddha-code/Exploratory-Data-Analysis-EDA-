# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the data through statistics and visualizations. The purpose is to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies to aid further machine learning modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Key Steps
- Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset.
- Generated summary statistics for key features (Age, Fare, Pclass, etc.).
- Created histograms and boxplots to visualize distributions and detect outliers.
- Analyzed relationships using correlation matrix and pairplots.
- Identified trends such as survival rates across passenger classes and genders.

## Included Files
- `cleaned_titanic.csv` - Preprocessed dataset used in analysis
- `Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing.ipynb` - Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing steps
- `Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA.ipynb` - Notebook showing detailed EDA with visualizations

## How to Run
Open and run the notebooks in a Jupyter environment to explore the data and visualize patterns.
