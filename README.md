Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the data using statistics and visualizations. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, anomalies, and feature relationships.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Key Steps
Loaded and summarized the dataset with descriptive statistics.

Visualized data distributions using histograms and boxplots for numeric features like Age and Fare.

Analyzed relationships between features via pairplots and correlation matrix.

Identified data patterns such as survival rates by passenger class, gender, and fare.

Noted outliers and drew basic inferences to guide further modeling.

Files Included
cleaned_titanic.csv: Cleaned dataset used for analysis.

Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA.ipynb: Notebook with code, visualizations, and insights.

Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing.ipynb: Supporting notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
